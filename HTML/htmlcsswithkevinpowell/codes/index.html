                    <h3>What is Bouldering?</h3>
                        <p>Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses.</p> 

                        <p>Unlike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_climbing" target="_main"> traditional climbing</a>, bouldering focuses on short but intensive routes called "problems," typically keeping climbers within a safe distance from the ground while they navigate challenging sequences of moves.</p>
